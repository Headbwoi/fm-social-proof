## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS

### What I learned

I learnt how to implement CSS FLEXBOX and CSS GRID in creating this page, which was really challenging. It looks simple but i spent more than 6hrs on this particular project.

```css
.container {
  background: url("images/bg-pattern-top-mobile.svg"),
    url("images/bg-pattern-bottom-mobile.svg");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
```
